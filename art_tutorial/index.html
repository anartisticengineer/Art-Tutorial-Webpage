			<h2 class="center-txt">Step 1: Photoshop</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Sample Images</b>:
				The first step is finding some good sample images.
				It's all in the shapes and forms for this step.
				I usually like using wave and cloud sample images.
				You can find plently of good (free) images via Unsplash.
				</li>
				<li><b>Blending Stuff Up</b>:
				Usually after putting (on average) 2 images, separate layers,
				I set the front layer blend mode to 'Difference'.
				From there do a bit of color adjusting to whatever you want:
				It'll probably change more in the end anyways. Add some "Hue/Saturation" layers to one or both
				of the sample images (directly above the respective image layers). Create clipping masks so each layer applies to the individual layer below,
				and not the whole image. Final touch, to make the colors a bit less harsh than what they likely are,
				add a "Solid Color" layer and set it to a 'fairly dark gray' (<strong>NOT</strong>
				completely black, or anything lighter than maybe a grayscale value 80-100). Set that solid
				color layer to blend mode "Lighten".
				</li>
				<li><b>Pack it all up</b>:
				Honestly, this step seems a lot more optional in theory, but it makes a lot less mess after.
				Select ALL the layers you just made, and convert it all to a smart object.
				Export all of this: we'll use the exported image for step 2.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<!-- STEP 2 -->
			<h2 class="center-txt">Step 2 (A): GIMP</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Open up GIMP. You're gonna want to install the GMIC plugin if you havent already.</li>
				<li>Open up the 'scrap' image wherever you saved it.</li>
				<li>Open the GMIC plugin to do the editing here. I usually use the effects in the <b>Degredations</b> section. That section has a lot of glitchy effects:
				honestly you can use whatever you want, but the <b>Pixel Sort</b> and <b>Warp by Intensity</b> are two favorites that I very commonly use.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Step 2 (B): Hex Editing in Webp Format</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>You can do this one and/or (A): but this step explains how I get the webp glitching effect.</li>
				<li>Open up that 'scrap' image from step 1 into honestly any image converter that can convert images to webp format. I recommend <b>ImageMagick</b>.
				It's completely free and doesn't take a lot of space.</li>
				<li>But whatever you use, convert the image to <b>.webp</b> format.</li>
				<li>Open the webp converted image into the hex editor. <strong>This next part is kinda important with this approach!</strong></li>
				<ol>
					<li>Save a copy of that webp image as the one you'll datamosh in the hex editor. Because most hex editors don't come with the ability to undo too much.
					So if you mess up, you'd have to go back to the previous step over again!</li>
					<li>There's a good article on how to datamosh with a hex editor, and it's the exact same approach here.
					There will be a whole bunch of hex numbers that look like absolute gibberish. Go down maybe 60-80% of the way down those long lines of complete nonsense.</li>
					<li>Change <b>ANYTHING</b>, but not too much. Maybe just replace a number (e.g. a "1" with "F" or something like that). But NOT at the beginning (Header).
					It would very likely corrupt the whole file and render it unreadable, which you obviously don't want to happen cause you don't want to start over again.</li>
					<li>You can usually open and view the result with a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc). When you like what you see, you can save the file.
					After that, you can go back to the converter to convert it back to a jpg/png file (something that Photoshop can read).</li>
				</ol>
			</ul>
			<!-- STEP 3-->
			<h2 class="center-txt">Step 3: Back to Photoshop</h2>
			<p>I say this throughout the tutorial, but this part here is definitely a lot more improv/whatever works best for you.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open up that document file from Step 1. Drag and drop the image(s) from the previous Step 2 into the file as new layers.</li>
				<li>You can honestly do whatever at this point, but here are some ideas based off of what I've done.</li>
				<ol>
					<li>Layer masks to hide & only show very specific aspects from each layer.</li>
					<li>Add a tiny bit of noise to give that organic feel.</li>
					<li>More color adjustments: <b>Curves</b> and maybe more<b>Hue/Saturation</b> layers should be good.</li>
				</ol>
